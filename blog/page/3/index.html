  <div class="entry-content"><h1>The CR48 and Chrome</h1>

<p>I am going to break this down into several sections, firstly looking at the
software, probably the most interesting part. Then the hardware which
currently is the most useful part of the whole ordeal. Then finally some of
the comparisons between other systems.</p>

<h2>Some background</h2>

<p>I have been using the CR48/ChromeOS as my primary laptop for 4 weeks now and
over Christmas at my parents as my main computer for 2 weeks. So I have had
some time as using it has my computer, with the iPad fulfilling all game and
multimedia options. In a nutshell basic browsing, email and sshing to my mac
for emacs and alpine. Right before I got the CR48 in the mail, I had sold my
MacbookPro since the iPad did most of what I needed and the Macbook had not
left the house for over 2 months. I figured it would be a good test for two
weeks at my parents and using it has my only web connection. (Used the iPad
for anything the CR48 was unsuited to)</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<h3>The Good</h3>

<p>The software is cool. Neat, unecumbered and easy to use. Those are all the
good things. The fact your data lives on the cloud means the times I
accidently trashed it I could simply wipe and restart, within 10 minutes I was
up and running. Guest accounts are awesome, I HATE that with the iPad if
someone wants to play with it they have access to my email and browser.
ChromeOS really leads the way here with how guesting is done and I hope other
systems take notice. The fact everything is encrypted so if someone stole my
laptop it would be hard for them to get any personal data. The battery also
seems to give exceptional life.</p>

<h3>The Bad</h3>

<p>If you do not have internet connection it is useless. That fact right there
trumps all other issues. Sure some of the HTML5 apps support some form of
offline storage but its nuetered, doesn&rsquo;t feel right or is downright clunky.
There are no native apps, nor are there any good media applications installed.
The laptop brimming with power becomes something you close, put in the corner
and wait for the internet to come back on because in rural KY verizon&rsquo;s
coverage just isn&rsquo;t enough. Meanwhile the iPad is playing movies, music and
games.</p>

<h4>The Browser</h4>

<p>Yep this falls under bad….but what?! WHY?! It is chrome, and chrome is
excellent. I use it on every system I can put it on. I love the design and
minimal features. The fact it just seems to fly. But on the CR48 chrome lags.
Here is a simple test. 1. Open a bunch of tabs 2. Before they have stopped
loading try to scroll on the one your on. On my system it is so laggy or
choppy has to be useless. Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t even respond until the others
have finally loaded. My workflow is to open a bunch of tabs with ctl click and
then sort them out later. This lag totally kills my workflow. The dirty little
secret is I loaded Ubuntu on the CR48, installed chrome and am typing this
while SSHing into my OSX for emacs, listening to music and chatting on
facebook with a bunch of tabs open while researching Markdown script. I
noticed very little lag, things seemed to keep moving at a decent pace and the
little CR48 seems to handle ubuntu pretty well with all the weight. Now why
can it not handle just chrome as well, this question eludes me.</p>

<h4>Lack of Remoting</h4>

<p>Whenever the remoting feature comes into play this may change significantly.
Currently at work I do .Net and Java(Android) work and at my desk is a big
decked out dell desktop. When I am in another office I want to just RDP to the
dell and do any work remotely. Conversly I have RDP and VNC on my Windows and
OSX boxes at work, so whenever I want to connect to them I want that power.
With the Ubuntu installation I can no problem. With ChromeOS, at this moment I
cannot.</p>

<h4>Lack of Native Apps</h4>

<p>Part of this goes against the very nature of ChromeOS. But ChromeOS needs
native applications, of at least some sort. Let them be connected to the cloud
and keep only a subset of data on the device. And make them run in full screen
or with the small dialogs at the bottom. Sandbox them in there own DMZ if you
must, but ChromeOS needs native applications in the worst way. Steal the base
libraries from those Android fellas, along with the basic ideas of the layours
but make the whole package keyboard and mouse friendly. Then if you setup a
new device you just get the whole shebang of installed applications along with
all the assorted chrome apps and extensions.</p>

<p>For example a friend came over, needed to checked email, browsed net,
facebooked and paid some bills. Then wanted to watch netflix while I finished
up on the computer. I told them they couldn&rsquo;t, then asked if there were any
movies, again I said there were not. At this time she reached for the iPad and
used it the rest of the day. Users expect a certain amount of functionality
built it.</p>

<h2>The Hardware</h2>

<p>This is the best &ldquo;lowend&rdquo; laptop I have ever used. As far as look and feel it
is above even the plastic macbook. This is what a small cheap laptop should
be. Not gaudy, 16GB is enough to be usable if it is not your main computer.
Processor is decent and 2GB of memory is enough for general usage. The feel of
the hardware is the greatest part. When you run your hands over the rubbery
surface and the chiclet keys. The screen while not superb is adequate enough.
Most importantly it is not guady or out of place. No huge decals saying
Intel/Windows/Nvidia/Whatever insider, nor any extra openings or ports. The
touchpad is above most non-apple machines and at the price point I assume the
this reaches it is great.</p>

<p>Some problems do occur, the VGA port is an unforgivable sin. This is 2010 and
DVI should be pretty standard around the land. There is an annoying seem near
the front and around the battery where things do not quite meet up. Probably
fine for the price point they are trying to hit, but it would have added just
a bit of extra polish. Likewise the touchpad is nice but not quite as silky
smooth as the macbooks in either feel or actual function.</p>

<h2>Comparisons</h2>

<h3>iPad</h3>

<p>The iPad is my favorite device I have bought within the past few years. At
first I didn&rsquo;t think it was useful, but after 30 minutes in the apple store I
realized that I had to have one. After a few months it replaced my MacbookPro
as my mobile computer.</p>

<p><em>At the heart of the matter the ChromeOS is a better web browser than the
iPad, in regards to almost any other functionality the iPad wins.</em></p>

<p>This is all that really needs to be said here, there are specific applications
for almost every imaginable purpose on the iPad, and each one of these is
better focused at one task than the chrome generally is.</p>

<h3>Netbook</h3>

<p>Here it is a bit closer since some notebooks are crap, and the hardware of
ChromeOS just feels so right so it wins in look and feel. I hate netbooks and
personally might use ChromeOS over one, but I cannot disregard they are more
functional at this time then ChromeOS. That being said I would prefer the
ChromeOS over Netbooks since to me Netbooks almost seem disposable, something
you use when you value price and lightness over any other attribute. In this
case I beleive ChromeOS might be more interesting, perhaps not more powerful.
But at least more interestig.</p>

<h3>Normal Laptop</h3>

<p>In this case I am talking about the 13-15&#8221; Windows/Apple laptop. The problem
is that the ChromeOS does not replace this device, given the choice of having
a desktop or laptop, most people opt for the laptop. In that case you need the
laptop to server as the base, and the ChromeOS loses much of it&rsquo;s luster. As
far as functionality the laptop wins hands down, the ChromeOS brings some
interesting concepts but a well tuned Apple laptop overcomes several of these
limitations and Windows 7 is a pretty decent OS.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<h3><em>ChromeOS is not the market moving factor Android is.</em></h3>

<p>I do not know how to distill it any smaller. It is neat, and it has some
promise but I do not think it has promise to the average consumer that Android
did, or that iOS has. Why am I comparing all this effort to Android? Simply
because Google has limited resources and I am sure there are some truly great
UI experts and guys who could be applying their efforts to Android. Are
traditional desktops going to the way of the dodo? No.</p>

<p>On the other hand they are not an emerging market. There are not vast new
fortunes to be made no matter how much google will try to push it. No non-geek
was even remotely interested in the laptop, the iPad or regular computers were
the go to box in my household. The device is a slave to another computer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Need to Print? Make sure you have it setup on your windows/osx/linux box with chrome printing enabled.</li>
<li>Want to Work in a Solid Office Program? Remote into your desktop to run Office or Pages/Numbers.</li>
<li>Want to store your movies or photoes or music? Again it is mostly on the desktop. Sure you can use something like smug mug but if you want to rename all files, or run a mass conversion your out of luck.</li>
</ul>


<p>My advice would be to take what you can out of the project and focus on making
Android excellent. I work in Android daily and there are tons of places where
money should be spent polishing or fixing up things. I am an Apple man myself,
but I would switch to Android if there was a better choice.</p>

<p>Sidenote: I wrote most of this article on the CR48 dual booting into Ubuntu,
and the experience was great. The hardware does really feel good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Beginning</p>

<p>Once upon a time when the world was young and the first batch of Cr48s were
sent out and the tracker was alive I noticed one being sent to my small town.
I watched that singular package has it made it&rsquo;s way from parts unknown to my
town and then eagerly came up with an excuse to stay home from work for a few
hours hoping it would land on my doorstep. At one point I noticed it had been
delivered but alas not to my doorstep. I became despondent and wrote it off
forever lamenting I would not be the alpha geek and have the first beta of the
chrome os. Twas a terrible time that is only dimly recorded.</p>

<p>Fast forward a week and my roommate told me I had a package at the house. Not
remembering any last minute Christmas gift when I opened it I saw the unique
packaging and knew that good times were a coming. A quick login of the my
google account a few minutes to update and boom I was browsing the web in a
chrome window. In a nutshell that is what this is and right now all that is
offered, Chrome browser with an attached keyboard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Preamble</h1>

<p>I was listening to the Talk Show a few weeks ago and one of their sponsors was
<a href="http://www.Squarespace.com">SquareSpace</a> and since I love the show and want
to support them I generally check out the sponsors to see if anything
interesting catches my eye.</p>

<h1>The Story</h1>

<p>Now for some time I have been struggling with some sort of blogging platform.
I have played with everything from nanoc to wordpress, but none of them really
fit my fancy. Nanoc was cool but I have no skill when it comes to graphical
design so my website could be generated and be really smooth but it still
looked terrible. Then Wordpress never quite fit the bill either, I didn&rsquo;t want
to maintain everything it required.</p>

<h1>The Hook</h1>

<p>That brings me to Squarespace which has some gorgeous themes and simple to use
and for $10 a month more than adequate. I figured it had a gallery and some
other options so I could consilidate my smugmug account, blog and other
services under one roof. The first roadblock I hit was the lack of any ftp for
bulk upload or just storing of files. Instead you have to place your files in
a zip file and upload them, ensuring that it does not go over the limit. This
annoyed me but I figured I could get around it. The second part was setting up
a photo gallery, playing aroudn with it I could get these wonderful lightbox
style gallery, but if I wanted more than one gallery you had to click on the
gallery then a single picture then you got the good looking gallery. I could
find no way to force it into that mode and contacted their support with little
success.</p>

<h1>The Initial Thoughts</h1>

<p>That being said it is a great service if you need something extremely simple,
the posting interface was intuitive and simple. I think it is one of the best
web 2.0 interfaces I have ever had the pleasure of using. Unfortunatly the
drawbacks outweighed the benefits. So my current approach is to host my blog
here, pictures at smugmug and have <a href="http://www.ppog.org">www.ppog.org</a> to be
the landing pad of all the sections.</p>

<h1>The Post Mortem</h1>

<p>I eventually turned away from this service since I needed something with a
little more control and something with FTP where I can upload some custom
pages. What I really needed was some sort of blogging platform. I looked at
blogger, posterous and tumblr. Obviously I eventually chose tumblr, I used
both posterous and tumblr for a bit but tumblr just seemed a bit better plus
the layout options I really liked. It is a service I would even pay for. So in
hindsight SquareSpace is an awesome service but for most people they can go
through a blogging service and have just as good usage, after all most people
don&rsquo;t need super uptime.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>An awesome program</h1>

<p><a href="http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/">KeyRemap4Macbook</a> is an awesome
program. Just go ahead and download it, if you want fine grained control over
your keyboard. The only thing I haven&rsquo;t been able to do is use it to switch my
iMac 27&#8221; between external and internal display.</p>

<p>Through the uber simple Keyboard preference I have my useless CAPS LOCK key
set to COMMAND key, this works in almost every program except when I am in
terminal in which I am using alpine and emacs, both of these make heavy use of
the control key and it is a pain to use my pinky. So after fooling with it for
a few hours one day I heard about KeyRemap4Macbook which contrary to the name
works on any mac. The documentation is a bit of a pain but I managed to make
it through it using the examples file. The one thing you must do is restart or
you will not even have a private.xml to edit.</p>

<p>This is my little control that is used to set the COMMAND_L key to CONTROL_L
<strong>ONLY</strong> and make terminal now extremely useful instead of hurting my pinky
figure. I named it Capslock as control since that is the physical keyname and
capslock is command as specified in the stock OSX keyboard preferences.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;root&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Terminal Uses CapsLock as Control&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;appendix&gt;&lt;/appendix&gt;
    &lt;identifier&gt;remap.capslock_ctrl&lt;/identifier&gt;
    &lt;only&gt;TERMINAL&lt;/only&gt;
    &lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::COMMAND_L,KeyCode::CONTROL_L&lt;/autogen&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Switch Monitors&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;identifier&gt;remap.switchmonitor&lt;/identifier&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;

<time datetime="2011-01-09T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 9<span>th</span>, 2011</time>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This could be part of an ongoing series about emacs and my thoughts, it is
very unstructured and might be rambling</em></p>

<h1>The Beginning</h1>

<p>Are you a programmer? Do you use some sort of all purpose utility text editor?
If you answered yes and then replied with Notepad or Visual Studio or XCode
then you should take another look. I once upon a time used Notepad2 or
Textmate depending on platform as my general use text editor. Both are
excellent text editors but I found a need for one that could run in a console
and for one that was cross platform without a lot of hassle. Two stalwarts
stood out among the crowd, two venerable old men in the land of text editors,
vi/vim and emacs. I chose emacs for probably silly reasons but once down the
road it stuck.</p>

<h1>The Start</h1>

<p>The first time you pick up emacs for whatever platform (and it is available
for all platforms), it will be an alien experience. The VERY first thing you
need to do is remap your caps lock to Control key, trust me on this.
<a href="http://www.randyrants.com/sharpkeys/">Sharpkeys</a> (Windows) and
<a href="http://mattdurham.tumblr.com/2011/01/09/keyremap4macbook.html">Remap4Macbook</a>
(OSX) are your friends. The first thing you need to understand is almost all
commands start with either control or meta (alt), c-x c-s saves, c-x c-f opens
a file and esc esc leaves the minibar at the bottom. This is all I knew at the
beginning and it was terrible, after a few days I put it away and went back to
my environments.</p>

<h1>Time Passes</h1>

<p>Time passed and I read more and great developers all seemed to use vi or
emacs, it also seemed pertinent that a text editor decades old would still be
good decades from now. Plus the UI is simplicity in itself and emacs in
particular can be a reader, calendar, organizer and directory manager all in
one. I read all this and knew I had to try it, so I forced myself into it and
it was painful. Be aware that this is painful and you must go through hell to
get to something awesome. Google is your friend on when trying to do something
with emacs, I still have the cheat sheet and my .emacs file is mostly stolen
from other posts.</p>

<p>Ultimately the thing that made me switch was org mode and more on that later,
but once I spent a few months on it I realized my fingers could fly while
doing things and macros were almost unthinking in doing some quick code
cleanup. While writing python code it worked extremely well and things seemed
to flow out of my fingers onto the keyboard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Been using tumblr as my springboard for the moment. The ease of choosing
themes and just getting things to work is pretty nice. Though whenever tumblr
went down that did sort of suck. So far it is a service I would pay for, right
now my files are hosted on <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">dreamhost</a> for just
general usage and ftp dumping ground. I am not a CSS or html oriented person
so this seems to fit my usage perfectly.</p>

<p>I can use dreamhost to dump all my files and things I don&rsquo;t want to keep on
tumblr. At some point I may make a little python crawler to crawl my tumblr
posts and put them on PPOG so that if tumblr goes down I can always show the
posts along with my resume and a handful of other little tidbits. I can only
hope at some point some really nice OSX editors pop up but for now a mixture
of Mars Edit and the web will have to work. I tried a few of the AIR clients
but none of them caught my eye or seemed to offer much.</p>

<p>A few years ago I got a Macbook Pro 15” and used a Swiss Backpack that worked
well but just never had any glamour or adventure to it. So I read a particular
Gadgeteer review and I was hooked. Part of my screamed at spending such an
amount on a Saddleback bag, so I spent much time debating and as always when I
wanted something that was expensive I filed it away and told myself if I
wanted it in a few months then I can get it. That is my own personal
concession to impulse buying. Most of the time it works pretty well and often
things pass after I have wanted them. So then I decided I wanted one. I didn’t
want to pay retail and they appeared on eBay with some regularity.</p>

<p>I hunted and tried to snipe until I found one for 380ish that was in perfect
condition, a large in this case. I bought it and eagerly awaited having a very
nice, spartan, cool bag. I carried it every day to and from work for years,
having a Macbook Pro 15”, charger, with various other small extras. Overtime
it evolved into a Macbook 13” and thenfinally what you see here, iPad,
Skullcandy Aviators and a Moleskine in the back.</p>

<p>Now that I have given you some history. Now time for the review.</p>

<h1>Initial Thoughts</h1>

<p>Granted this are somewhat fuzzy since I have had the bag for several years. I
remember being entranced by it, the mythos the color and the indestructibility
of the bag. This leather was think, think of the thickest leather you can and
then double that. The stitching is superb, heavy and thick and after several
years of daily usage I can see no wearing. The clips are heavy duty and their
are no zippers to wear out.</p>

<h1>Packability</h1>

<p>What can you easily put it in and how many nooks and crannies does it have? It
is a pretty simply bag, one large compartment in the back, one large on int
the front with two small pouches that I generally stick my iPad charger in and
in the other any other small cords I need. Two small sleeves on the inside,
two small sleeves on the outside I rarely use, and then in the large back
pocket a hidden compartment I have never used. Finally there is pocket on the
back you could put a magazine or notebook in. Guess what I put in there?</p>

<p>Compared to the Swiss backpack I had the saddleback is not as efficient. I
tend to carry less with the saddleback since it is harder to dig into the
bottom to find anything lose. On the flip side this forces me to carry only
the essentials. On the flip side I have found I can cram two days clothes in
the bag, granted it is almost busting at the seems but is handy when I only
want to pack one bag.</p>

<h1>Padding and Protection</h1>

<p>To be honest it is minimal, the leather will almost never let anything pierce
the leather and the seams where the leather is sewn together gives it quite a
bit of structure. I generally left my laptops bare but my iPad gets wrapped up
in the excellent STM case. Again it falls short of the older Swiss backpack I
had. That backpack had a good layer of padding that wrapped the laptop. That
being said I have tossed the bag into the back of the car and on the floor
with nary a problem.</p>

<h1>Durability</h1>

<p>Perhaps in some distant future mutants in the post apocalyptic
<a href="http://fallout.bethsoft.com/index.html">Fallout</a> will be using the bag to
store their fresh water and ammo.</p>

<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>

<p>If I look back upon it the Swiss backpack I had outclassed it in almost every
category, its a 1/3 of the price, provides better protection, you can put more
into the backpack and is more comfortable to wear as a backpack. <em>You can wear
the Saddleback as a backpack but I only did so once.</em> That being said I would
take the Saddleback every time, it looks better, gives a sense of adventure,
people comment about it, and it just plain does not look like a laptop bag.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have had my <a href="http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/customizer.html">Unicomp</a>
for a few years now. So this is just a short review and description of the
keyboard. A few years ago my normal keyboard broke and I figured I would go
all out with a Model M style after reading about how people loved them, plus
vague memories as a child in typing classes which had the click clack of
dozens of Model Ms going on at one time.</p>

<p>Researched a bit and Unicomp bought the rights to the design and even better
just 45 minutes away in Lexington. Ponying up the money I bought one and in a
day or so I had one of these beasts in my hand.</p>

<p>You can notice the excellent Lamy 2000 fountain pen sitting on the keyboard.
This keyboard is not meant for someone on the move. The thing is heavy and
solid, brick like. Each time you type a key you get a very satisfying click
clack and the space bar feels like a joy to use after using the membrane
keyboards. The spaces between the keys look and feel like cliffs because of
how deep the keys are. If you pop each key up you will find a spring there,
hence the name of buckling spring keyboard.</p>

<p>This thing is a joy to type on and on my huge iMac it feels just right. Sadly,
I do not have one at work, the noise alone would kill my coworkers even an
office down. I have a Filco Brown Cherry keyboard I hope to use for the office
to replace my acceptable but still not great Apple Keyboard.</p>

<p>Its loud, heavy, but is intensely satisfying and will last forever. Buy one!
