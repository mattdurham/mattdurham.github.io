  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have had my <a href="http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/customizer.html">Unicomp</a>
for a few years now. So this is just a short review and description of the
keyboard. A few years ago my normal keyboard broke and I figured I would go
all out with a Model M style after reading about how people loved them, plus
vague memories as a child in typing classes which had the click clack of
dozens of Model Ms going on at one time.</p>

<p>Researched a bit and Unicomp bought the rights to the design and even better
just 45 minutes away in Lexington. Ponying up the money I bought one and in a
day or so I had one of these beasts in my hand.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ld36szrYQl1qeofh2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can notice the excellent Lamy 2000 fountain pen sitting on the keyboard.
This keyboard is not meant for someone on the move. The thing is heavy and
solid, brick like. Each time you type a key you get a very satisfying click
clack and the space bar feels like a joy to use after using the membrane
keyboards. The spaces between the keys look and feel like cliffs because of
how deep the keys are. If you pop each key up you will find a spring there,
hence the name of buckling spring keyboard.</p>

<p>This thing is a joy to type on and on my huge iMac it feels just right. Sadly,
I do not have one at work, the noise alone would kill my coworkers even an
office down. I have a Filco Brown Cherry keyboard I hope to use for the office
to replace my acceptable but still not great Apple Keyboard.</p>

<p>Its loud, heavy, but is intensely satisfying and will last forever. Buy one!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was listening to the <a href="http://thetalkshow.net/">Talk Show</a> a few weeks ago
and one of their sponsors was <a href="http://squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> and since
I love the show and want to support them I generally check out the sponsors to
see if anything interesting catches my eye.</p>

<p>Now for some time I have been struggling with some sort of blogging platform.
I have played with everything from nanoc to wordpress, but none of them really
fit my fancy. Nanoc was cool but I have no skill when it comes to graphical
design so my website could be generated and be really smooth but it still
looked terrible. Then Wordpress never quite fit the bill either, I didn&rsquo;t want
to maintain everything it required.</p>

<p>That brings me to Squarespace which has some gorgeous themes and simple to use
and for $10 a month more than adequate. I figured it had a gallery and some
other options so I could consolidate my smugmug account, blog and other
services under one roof. The first roadblock I hit was the lack of any ftp for
bulk upload or just storing of files. Instead you have to place your files in
a zip file and upload them, ensuring that it does not go over the limit. This
annoyed me but I figured I could get around it. The second part was setting up
a photo gallery, playing around with it I could get these wonderful lightbox
style gallery, but if I wanted more than one gallery you had to click on the
gallery then a single picture then you got the good looking gallery. I could
find no way to force it into that mode and contacted their support with little
success.</p>

<p>That being said it is a great service if you need something extremely simple,
the posting interface was intuitive and simple. I think it is one of the best
web 2.0 interfaces I have ever had the pleasure of using. Unfortunately the
drawbacks outweighed the benefits. So my current approach is to host my blog
here, pictures at smugmug and have <a href="http://www.ppog.org">PPOG</a> to be the
landing pad of all the sections.</p>
