  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Keyboards</h2>

<p>I love keyboards. I have to many right now and am thinking of buying a <a href="http://geekhack.org/showthread.php?t=16163">KBC
Poker</a> at some point. Even though
I really don&rsquo;t need another one, but the thought of the minimalist layout and
the fact at home I have a large <a href="http://store.razerzone.com/store/%0Arazerusa/en_US/pd/productID.211324200">BlackWidow</a> which is a large keyboard, at least
compared to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Majestouch-%0ATenkeyless-Tactile-Action-Keyboard/dp/B00304DCMG/ref=pd_cp_e_0">Filco Tenkeyless</a> I use at work.
The Filco is brown cherry switches which make a more hollow sound, whereas the
BlackWidow is blues and has a very clicky noise. I am not sure which I like
better, I like the Filco overall better than the black widow, but the build
quality on it is better.</p>

<h2>Let us meet the keyboards</h2>

<p><strong>Note: All credit given to respective sites</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here is the KBC Poker &ndash; I want this, I will probably buy one and then unload it if I don&rsquo;t want it.</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.ppog.org/files/kbcpoker.jpg" alt="KBC Poker" /></p>

<p><strong>Now for my current favorite and champion, the Filco Tenkeyless</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.ppog.org/files/tenkeyless.jpg" alt="Filco TenkeyLess" /></p>

<p><strong>Then the indestructible unicomp, this thing will outlast the others combined.</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.ppog.org/files/unicomp.jpg" alt="Unicomp" /></p>

<p><strong>Finally my at home daily driver, the BlackWidow</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.ppog.org/files/blackwidow.jpg" alt="BlackWidow" /></p>

<h3>Why I switched from membrane dome?</h3>

<p>99.99% of all home computers have a membrane keyboard, these are cheap
keyboards that use a pcb and when the rubber membrane makes contact it closes
a tiny gap. At one point I used a scissor switch keyboard but one of the keys
went bad and I tried to fix it and it never felt right after that.</p>

<p>So then I found a website, <a href="http://www.geekhack.org">GeekHack</a> and became
hooked, within a month I had almost $300 worth of keyboards. Plus on top of
that I had an accumulation of Apple keyboards I have collected over the years.
I found that I disliked membrane pads, because they did&rsquo;t feel as smooth, I
like the thud/click has my hands fly over the keyboard in emacs, it is
something magical.</p>

<h3>What is a mechanical keyboard?</h3>

<p>Whereas mechanicals use a variety of methods, the two most common are cherry
switches and buckling springs. I have a
<a href="http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/">Unicomp</a> that I used for several years
but I like the lighter touch of the cherry springs. A great little overview is
on <a href="http://www.overclock.net/keyboards/491752-mechanical-%0Akeyboard-guide.html">overclock.net</a>.</p>

<p>A mechanical keyboard will last longer than any mass produced membrane
keyboard, it will allow most people to type quicker, and generally has better
quality. That being said it is not for everyone, some people enjoy membranes
and almost every membrane is quieter than a mechanical. Also most mechanicals
do not come with media features, wireless and other options that might be a
necessity.</p>

<h3>Finally</h3>

<p>Find a mechanical keyboard and give it a try, see what you think. You may be
surprised. I plan on writing individual reviews as time goes on. I
particularly like using the unicomp on the iPad, don&rsquo;t ask me why, I think it
is the absurdity of it all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Slickrun &ndash; The Windows Launcher</h1>

<p>Part of my great tools series is a little launcher called
<a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/SlickRun/">Slickrun</a>. The quick and short is
<strong>This is the simplest tool that could get the job done</strong> There are other
tools that have reams of features and refined interfaces, Colibri and Launchy
are examples of two. Also on OSX I use Alfred which I find indispensable, even
though it shares more with launchy than Slickrun.</p>

<h2>What is slickrun?</h2>

<p>Slickrun is a simple launcher that associates a command with a short text. You
invoke it by hitting a keyboard combination, in my case alt+space. Then type
in a command and boom an application is there waiting to be used. <strong>Slickrun
has replaced my Windows start button</strong> I no longer use the Windows Start
button on a daily basis. I use slickrun.</p>

<h2>Why is slickrun better than the alternatives?</h2>

<p>Any of the launchers are pretty good and for the most part an improvement over
the stock windows experience. This one though is simple, unobtrusive, fast to
load and slow to anger. Written in delphi it has a bit of a dated look, but
then again I never really see Slickrun. Its a small blue band that does my
bidding and then I have it set to autohide, I never notice it, A blue blip
that does my bidding is what slickrun is. <em>The other alternatives always
seemed too slow and obtrusive for what I wanted for a windows launcher.</em></p>

<p>I have used Enzo, Colibri and Launchy and yet my needs were small and Slickrun
did it with minimal fuss, almost no overhead and with killer speed. <strong>In
short, Slickrun does one thing, but does it well</strong> I tend to look for apps
that do one thing and do it well.</p>

<p>Go grab slickrun and give it a try, once you install it the less you notice
the better of a job it is doing.</p>

<p><em>On a total aside I am writing this in Elements on my iPad using a Unicomp
Customizer (Model M clone) that weighs more and is larger than the iPad. My
how the world turns.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>One Text Editor to Rule Them All</h1>

<h2>Stream of thought about emacs</h2>

<p>I love emacs. I loathe it at times. I never could get used to Vim. All my
computers now remap caps lock to control. Org mode is amazing.  Gar, why is it
written in lisp. Can I write something in python. I wish it was as small as
vim.</p>

<p>Preface up front, I am no emacs guru most of my .emacs is stolen from people
wiser than myself.</p>

<h2>emacs for those not in the know</h2>

<p>emacs is one of the holy two text editors. Vim being the other. Both are
extremely capable editors, every programmer should know one of them, to be
honest I don&rsquo;t care which. The history of emacs is best documented
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsHistory">here</a>. emacs could best be
described as an archaic editor that offers unlimited customization if you
spend time with emacs. At the heart emacs is a text manipulator, beyond that
it can answer email, read newsgroups, play tetris and act as a shell plus a
thousand other options. If you have read my other posts you will know I love
small tools that do one thing exceedingly well, that are simple and to the
point. emacs is the exact opposite of this, I will try to explain why I love
emacs.</p>

<h2>Why do I think every programmer needs to know emacs (vim)?</h2>

<p>A programmers tool for putting ideas into action is the lowly text editor.
Everything we do centers around entering text and having a computer process
that and help someone do something. <em>But what of IDEs?</em> asks the peanut
gallery. I love IDEs, software would be difficult without top notch IDEs like
Eclipse and VS, but every programmer needs to have a secret weapon in the
closet. Something powerful, something emacs.</p>

<ul>
<li>emacs is cross platform, via usb drive/dropbox I can have a live emacs ready to go wherever I go. The commands are all the same and it all looks the same. Everyone needs a stable text editor.</li>
<li>emacs is stable, emacs has been around a long time, it also has some of the worlds best developers working on it. The core code is solid, this is a program you can leave running for months without blinking an eye, I mean it is practically an OS anyways! </li>
<li>emacs is customizable, if there is some software more customizable than emacs I don&rsquo;t know what it is. Granted most people just cut and paste bits from other people but you can change the very foundations of emacs with knowing just a bit of lisp and how emacs functions.</li>
<li>emacs will go where no files have gone before, need to open enormous files. emacs is up to the task. Need to work with python, xml, c#, java or just good ole txt. emacs can handle that.</li>
<li>emacs is free of distraction. The actual ui is very simple. Some text buffers and then a command buffer at the bottom. </li>
</ul>


<p>All that being said I know plenty of good, perhaps great programmers who never
touch emacs(vim). <em>emacs is not for everyone, it has plenty of faults, and
speaking of faults.</em></p>

<h2>emacs, the archaic</h2>

<p>Ever get the feeling that a program is secretly trying to kill you? emacs
sometimes likes to do that. For instance emacs should just pop up and say, <em>oh
I notice you have not remapped the caps lock key, let me fix that for you
before your pinky falls off</em>. If you haven&rsquo;t remapped that key do so now
<a href="http://www.randyrants.com/sharpkeys/">SharpKeys</a> for windows or Keyboard
Options for OSX. Now thats better, now you don&rsquo;t have to stretch that pinky
all the way down there. Feels better doesn&rsquo;t it? Now go read an article on
emacs, download some extensions, include them in your emacs. Put in some
random lisp command that you got from Paul Graham. Now boom something awesome
happens and you don&rsquo;t really know why or how, and if you try to look at the
lisp your head spins because they went way over the qouta on parantheses.</p>

<p>emacs is archaic and has a lot of history that no longer seems pertinent. That
being said it has one mode that is more awesome than awesomo.</p>

<h2>org mode</h2>

<p>Just go read about it <a href="http://orgmode.org/">here</a>. I will wait. This is one of
the best tools available. I use org mode more in emacs than text mode. It is
that important to me. My coworkers think it is mystical how I can create an
html report detailing what I have done and when I completed it on the fly.
Then I show them the deep linking and nesting and all the other awesome things
org mode can do. I can see the envy in their eyes, the same way they envy my
filco ten keyless keyboard. Yet when I show them emacs they cringe and decide
to find other ways.</p>

<h2>Are you interested yet?</h2>

<p>If you try emacs and hate it then try vim. If you hate both then give emacs a
try a few months down the road. Fiddle with it, try to do some simple text
editing read the tutorial. I spent months maybe a year in an on and off
relationship with emacs. I hated it with a passion but I read how people loved
it. Then I got OSX and started doing some development via ssh logging into the
OSX box and writing python or objective-c and needed a command line text
editor. So I jumped in and have only peeked back once or twice. All the while
letting my fingers remember archaic commands.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At my workplace, HCHB, we are rewriting our product for Android since windows
mobile 6.5 is pretty much dead and even finding hardware is becoming an
increasingly difficult task. So 8 months ago we jumped into the world of java,
android and eclipse. The shift from c++ to java has been nothing but smiles
and unicorns. We will have a 1/3 less code. Plus the code is properly layered
and more readable, but that is mainly from the benefits of starting with a
good framework and not coding things in the ui layer like the winmo product
is.</p>

<p>That being said I have some thoughts on android programming concepts.</p>

<h2>XML layout is pure win</h2>

<p>This is awesome, and a very powerful tool once you get the hang of it. Granted
the eclipse plugin to view your layout is useless but its easy enough to look
at a layout on the device. The whole R resource thing is mostly great, though
when you have something like 200 screens it is cumbersome and you have to
practice good naming convention.</p>

<h2>Intents are great for small apps, killer (in a bad way) for large ones</h2>

<p>If you are not familiar with the android way, when you enter a new screen
information is passed along via intents and when you exit it can be passed
back via intents. The same concept is also used when you rotate the screen.
This means the UI really drives the creation and destruction of the business
logic and you generally have to keep the cached object in the intent or in
your sqlite instances.</p>

<p><strong>For most small apps this works great, for ours, we chose a different road</strong></p>

<h2>The Long Road &ndash; The path we took</h2>

<p>Our product has to maintain backward compatibility with the winmo code at a
database layer so we couldn&rsquo;t easily use sqlite to store state, and it needed
to behave semi-close to winmo to make coding quicker. Also we have grandiose
plans to implement this on other platforms that may never happen. Plus we
didn&rsquo;t really like the way the stock android handles everything so…</p>

<h3>Everything hangs off the Application</h3>

<p>The application is a built in singleton for every android application, we
subclass this and all of our business logic hangs off of this application
object in some form of another. How does this all work? Whenever a parent
kicks off a child screen, we create what we call presenter objects which
determine the flow of business logic to the actual screen. We put the hash
code of the child presenter into the child views intent, the child presenter
is then thrown into a list. Once the child view is created it grabs the hash
code out of the intent, looks it up in the global list and then marries itself
to the presenter via interfaces.</p>

<h3>Presenter and View Marriage</h3>

<p>This way we keep the presenter/business logic separate from the ui. We can
also better support different screens, for instance on a Droid we generally
show a list, then tapping on a item takes you to a details screen. So we have
a presenter that handles phone type devices with a business object handling
validation, moving the data to and from the database etc. On a tablet though
we might want to integrate the list and details onto the same screen. So we
just right a new presenter that uses the same underlying business objects as
the first.</p>

<p>Once the child view is closed we pass the child presenter to the parent
presenter in a child finished method, then divorce the two so garbage
collection can take place.</p>

<h2>What does this all buy us?</h2>

<ul>
<li>We get well seperated logic, the Views handle their internal state. Controls keep track of themselves and redraw on views.</li>
<li>In our case the business logic is actually on a different thread so we can do long running queries without adversely impacting the gui.</li>
<li>We can theoretically support multiple platforms.</li>
<li>The application is pretty easy to unit test and we try to write it in a way that makes it easy. Though we do not unit test every corner we generally unit test the tough stuff, <em>crosses fingers</em> will unit test the other things when we get the time.</li>
</ul>

<time datetime="2011-03-17T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 17<span>th</span>, 2011</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Alpine</h1>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_li7j1jrgdz1qeofh2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is <a href="http://www.washington.edu/alpine/acquire/">Alpine</a> my email client of
choice. A few years ago my work computer was a P4 with 2 gigs of ram. Whenever
I opened Outlook with Visual Studio open plus a web browser and all the other
cruft that is open daily I would hear the grinding of my hard drive and know
my computer was about slow down. Outlook was eating roughly 60-100 megs of
memory loading all the various things it does, and on top of that I did not
like the interface.</p>

<p>That triggered a quest to find a light email client that I could live with. I
tried the emacs client, but it was to arcane even for emacs. I tried sylpheed,
thunderbird and claws. None of them scratched an itch. Then I happened to find
Alpine, and it changed how I handle email.</p>

<p>What is the secret of this app? That each screen focuses on one thing and one
thing only. You don&rsquo;t get a 3 pane layout. You see the list of messages and
have to view them to see the text, but you get the whole real estate when you
do so. <strong>Every screen is razor sharp and focused on doing whatever it needs to
do without muddying the waters. That is the secret.</strong></p>

<h2>But first the bad</h2>

<p>This is a keyboard driven product, and the editor pico is unwieldy for most
users. Pico lacks most decent editing capabilities, it is functional but
spartan. Viewing HTML message requires you to view the HTML in your browser
and responding in HTML is almost impossible. The other big issue that when you
view images that are referenced within the email you cannot see them inline.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<h3>Keyboard Centric</h3>

<p>To someone like me the keyboard is your main entry with the mouse being there
for support. I can fly using Alpine. Set me say I want to search all messages
that contain the text &ldquo;design&rdquo;, here are my keystrokes ; T A Design ENTER.
Without moving the mouse, plus when the results come up I can use the keyboard
to scroll through them.</p>

<h3>Speedy and Lean</h3>

<p>This thing uses little memory and is very fast, saving to the mbox can
sometimes take a second or two but for searching, scrolling through results
and most other tasks it does extremely fast. Also consumes about a tenth of
the memory Outlook did. Mine generally sits around 4-8 megs depending on what
folder I have open.</p>

<h3>Extremely Rich Filtering Rules</h3>

<p>Alpine has an extremely rich filtering system where you can filter by specific
headers, push to an external program or do other crazy things. My needs are
pretty tame, move into this folder, flag this or delete that.</p>

<h3>Small Install and Portable</h3>

<p>Tiny install with a pine.rc and you are good to go. You can also store your
configuration on the mail server if you wish.</p>

<h3>Stable</h3>

<p>I have never had it crash, ever.</p>

<h2>Wishlist</h2>

<h3>HTML View insert the images</h3>

<p>It is a pain, would be nice if it could copy the html over and auto link the
images so they are view inline. In an ideal world it could even display the
HTMLized view when I open the message and show it there.</p>

<h3>Replace Pico with Windows Specific/OSX Specific Editor</h3>

<p>Give some native editing, the ability to cut and paste using the normal OS
commands. Maybe some basic HTML commands or at least the ability to insert
pictures. Basically make it look more native while retaining the keyboard
navigation and focus on showing just a single thing.</p>
